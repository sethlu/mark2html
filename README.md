A quick way to generate basic websites with your markdowns

# Development

After cloning the repo, run `npm install`.

You may find some samples demoing the features under `examples/`. To generate a website, run `bin/cli.js path/to/markdown.md`; running `bin/cli.js examples/assignment-sample/instructions.md` will generate a website placed in the file's directory `examples/assignment-sample/instructions_dist/`.
